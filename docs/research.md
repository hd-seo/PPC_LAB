    <h3>Personalized Medicine</h3>
    <p>We investigate individual variability in drug response due to genetic, environmental, and physiological factors. Our goal is to develop predictive models for drug efficacy and toxicity.</p>

  <div class="bento-card">
    <h3>Pharmacogenomics (PGx)</h3>
    <p>We identify genetic markers associated with drug response. By analyzing genomic data, we aim to implement PGx testing in clinical practice to prevent adverse drug reactions.</p>

    <h3>Clinical Pharmacology</h3>
    <p>We conduct pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling to optimize dosage regimens for various patient populations, including pediatrics and the elderly.</p>

    <h3>Pharmacoepidemiology</h3>
    <p>Using real-world data (RWD) and big data analytics, we evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medications in large populations.</p>
